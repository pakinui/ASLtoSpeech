## About

Working together as a team, we've selected two distinct datasets to create a unique and impactful application: one that translates ASL gestures into text, and another that converts text into spoken language. This innovative combination allows us to facilitate communication across three different formats: ASL gestures, written text, and spoken words. Our primary objective is to create an inclusive environment for both the deaf and hard of hearing individuals, as well as those who may not be familiar with sign language.
