## About

Working together as a team, we've selected two distinct datasets to create a unique and impactful application: one that translates ASL gestures into text, and another that converts text into spoken language. This innovative combination allows us to facilitate communication across three different formats: ASL gestures, written text, and spoken words. Our primary objective is to create an inclusive environment for both the deaf and hard of hearing individuals, as well as those who may not be familiar with sign language.

## Guidelines
1.  Source code that builds ✅ (application with TTS)
2.  Version control (e.g. git) :white_check_mark:
3.  Continuous Integration ✅ (builds and runs application using GitHub Actions)
4.  Tests :x:
5.  Coverage reports :x: (can't access git right now)
6.  Static source code analysis :white_check_mark:
7.  Documentation :white_check_mark:
8.  Questionnaire :white_check_mark: (Can be accessed [here](https://forms.office.com/r/hqKygen2MY))
 
## Features

**Essential Features:**

1.  **ASL to Speech:** Convert ASL gestures captured by the camera into text and then output them as spoken words. :white_check_mark:
2.  **Subtitles:** Display subtitles in distinct colors for both the ASL user and the person speaking. :question:

**Potential/Along-the-line Features:**

1.  **Record Transcript:** Optional feature to save conversation transcripts as .txt files. :x:
