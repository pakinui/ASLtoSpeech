## Project Goals:
We're working on an app that brings together people who use American Sign Language (ASL) and those who speak verbally. 
Our Sign Language to Speech App is all about using tech like machine learning and text-to-speech to turn ASL gestures into spoken words. 
Our goal is to make communication easy and fun, breaking down barriers and connecting folks in a whole new way!

## Essential Features:
1.  ASL to Speech: Convert ASL gestures captured by the camera into text and then output them as spoken words.
2.  Subtitles: Display subtitles in distinct colors for both the ASL user and the person speaking.

## Potential/In-The-Works Features:
1.  Record Transcript: Optional feature to save conversation transcripts as .txt files.
2.  Add Gestures: Allow users to add custom gestures to expand the vocabulary of the app.
3.  Change Voice: Provide users with the flexibility to select and customize the synthesized voice.
4.  Emotion Detector: Utilize facial emotion recognition to infuse emotion into the generated speech.
5.  Dictionary Mode: Offer a comprehensive list of ASL gestures with an option to bookmark for future learning.
6.  Speech to Text: Enable voice recording for users and transform recorded speech into written text for interactive conversations.
